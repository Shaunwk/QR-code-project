# QR-code-project
Project from Frontend Mentor - QR code 
 
This was my very first challenge I did and the first repository I ever made. 

Looking back I would use rem instead of px on the padding in CSS. 
Overall it was a great starting challenge and have built off of the basics in newer challenges.
